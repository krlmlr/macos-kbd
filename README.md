# macos-kbd

My favorite keyboard layouts.

## Installation

Needs `sudo` because it writes to `/Library`.
Inspect [`bootstrap`](https://github.com/krlmlr/macos-kbd/blob/main/bootstrap) to see what's going on.

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krlmlr/macos-kbd/main/bootstrap | sudo sh
```
